# RECOIL GROWTH
There are two directories, one for the implementation of the algorithm in 2D and the other for 3D.
## Objective
To implement the recoil growth algorithm in a 2D and a 3D lattice for different modeling systems.

### Current System to Implement
Several polymer chains in one lattice to study end-to-end chain distribution.

**User-defined variables**
* Number of monomers per chain, `N`.
* Number of chains, `chains`
* Number of possible trial directions, `k`, that can go up to four.
* Length of the lattice side, `size`
* Maximum number of recoil steps, `l_max`

### Future Systems to Implement
1. One polymer chain and a solvent in a lattice
2. Several polymer chains with a solvent in a lattice
3. Systems with higher value of `k`.
